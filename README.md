# This simple MATLAB app is designed to identify and save minimum and/or maximum values from datasets imported from files (e.g., CSV, TXT). 
# It allows for adjusting the criteria used to detect peaks and additional manual filtering. 
# The fringes position can be saved to a file for further analysis.
